    <h1>About Wishly</h1>

    <p>
      Wishly is a simple online greeting platform created to help people
      share personalized messages with ease. Our goal is to make digital
      greetings more meaningful by allowing users to create custom
      greeting links using names.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a world where messages are often rushed and generic, Wishly
      provides a quick and thoughtful way to connect with friends,
      family, and loved ones during special moments such as holidays,
      birthdays, and celebrations.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to make online greetings personal, simple, and
      accessible to everyone. We believe small personalized gestures
      can create meaningful connections.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Wishly Exists</h2>
    <p>
      Wishly was created to remove the stress of designing greeting
      cards or writing messages from scratch. With just a name and a
      click, users can generate a shareable greeting link in seconds.
    </p>

    <h2>Transparency</h2>
    <p>
      Wishly does not require user registration and does not store
      personal data entered into the greeting generator. We are committed
      to providing a safe, user-friendly, and transparent experience.
